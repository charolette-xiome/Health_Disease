In this project, I utilized a heart disease dataset to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. 
I first preprocessed the data by splitting it into training and testing sets, with the target variable being 'target'.
A Decision Tree Classifier was initially used, yielding an accuracy score on the test set. 
To improve prediction accuracy, I employed a Random Forest Classifier with 37 estimators, which significantly enhanced the model's performance.
The project demonstrates the application of ensemble learning techniques to achieve better accuracy in medical diagnosis, particularly in predicting heart disease outcomes.
